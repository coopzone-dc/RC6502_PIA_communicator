New version of the Arduino sketch, for communicating with the PIA 6821 chip on an Apple 1 replica. Mainly the RC6502 but others will be able to use it if that are using the same type of Arduino Nano setup

I have to say credit to Tor-Eirik Bakke Lunde, for creating the replica to begin with. It's great fun going back to the 70's

This software is for use with:

Have fun.
